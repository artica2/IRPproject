Due to file sizes, the project was pushed without the LLM files themselves. To redownload, go to the sample scene, go to the LLM holder object, and swap the model (under model settings) to OpenHermes 2.5. If the project opens already on the Hermes LLM, swap to any other model (e.g. mistral) and then swap back.
